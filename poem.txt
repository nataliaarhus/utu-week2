In the land of frost, where winter reigns,
Amidst the pines, where snow enchains,
Lies a tale of yule in Nordic scenes,
With Java's warmth 'midst wintry means.

In cozy huts, by hearths aglow,
Where reindeer roam in frosty snow,
The code unwinds, a programmer's lair,
With Java's might in the coder's care.

Through fjords and forests, the lights alight,
In Java's lines, a festive sight,
Nordic spirits dance in code's embrace,
A Christmas tale in Java's grace.

So as the auroras paint the sky,
And Nordic winds in whispers sigh,
Java hums its merry refrain,
In Christmas cheer, the code shall reign.
